# Awesome OpenX [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge-flat2.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of awesome applications, libraries and datasets concerning the development and testing of automated driving functions with a focus on [ASAM OpenX Standards](https://www.asam.net/standards/) (e.g. [OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/), [OpenSCENARIO](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/openscenario/), ...).

This is a list of [free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) software and datasets, whereas non-free software will be listed on the [non-free](non-free.md) page.
Also, check out ASAM's official [open source platform](https://github.com/asam-oss).
The structure of this list was inspired by [awesome selfhosted](https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted).
